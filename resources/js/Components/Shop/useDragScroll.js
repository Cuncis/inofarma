/**
 * Lets a horizontally-scrolling strip be dragged with a held mouse cursor,
 * not just swiped with a finger — touch already scrolls a `overflow-x-auto`
 * strip natively (with momentum), so this only wires up mouse events;
 * reimplementing it for touch would fight that native scrolling.
 *
 * Tracks the drag with window-level `mousemove`/`mouseup` listeners rather
 * than `setPointerCapture` — capture ties the drag to the element, so a
 * release outside it (dragged past the strip's edge) never reaches this
 * component and the "just dragged" flag is left stuck, silently swallowing
 * every click afterwards. `setPointerCapture` has also historically had
 * cross-browser quirks around suppressing the click that follows it. Window
 * listeners sidestep both.
 *
 * Spread the returned props onto the scrollable element. A drag that moves
 * more than `DRAG_THRESHOLD` swallows the click that would otherwise follow
 * — so a `Link`/`button` inside the strip doesn't navigate when the shopper
 * was just dragging past it.
